	Catppuccin Icons
    </h3>

<p align="center">
    A collection of <strong>over 100!</strong> icons I made to fit together with the <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin">Catppuccin color scheme.</a><br>
    For now, only the Macchiato flavor is covered, as it's the one I use myself.

<h3 align="center">Why?</h3>
<p align="center">
I started this as a small over-the-weekend project because I wanted to "rice" my Windows machine with Catppuccin and have my icons fit into that. 
After posting this to reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsporn/comments/197ct82/working_on_recreating_icons_in_catppuccin_style/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsporn/comments/197vbxl/as_per_request_updated_icon_pack_progression/">here</a> I got a lot of suggestions for new icons and what have been like 30 icons before is now 113 icons big! And because people kept asking for a download link, I decided to post them on GitHub.

So... <strong>here they are!</strong>

If you want to suggest new icons or have ideas on how to improve existing ones, please feel free to reach out! I'm still new to this whole GitHub thingt, but I think I'll manage :)
